### Hi, I'm Ty (he/him)
I have been building websites, web apps, mobile apps, design systems, and most anything in between for over a decade. I am currently a Senior Frontend Engineer at [Givebutter](https://givebutter.com), helping bring together everything changemakers need to successfully raise funds for good causes.

I occasionally take on freelance design or development projects. If you're looking for that sort of thing, feel free to [email me](mailto:tywayne@fastmail.com) or hit me up on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/tywayne).
