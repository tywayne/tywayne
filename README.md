### Hi, I'm Ty (he/him)
For the past decade, I've worked in design and front end development across a variety of industries. I am currently a Developer at [Rehash](https://rehash.com), building successful retail and ecommerce experiences.

I occasionally take on freelance design or development projects. If you're looking for that sort of thing, feel free to [email me](mailto:tywayne@hey.com) or hit me up on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/tywayne).
